<div class="textblock"><p>My collected rationales for placing these libraries in the public domain:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">Public domain vs. viral licenses</p>
<p class="startli">Why is this library public domain? Because more people will use it. Because it's not viral, people are not obligated to give back, so you could argue that it hurts the development of it, and then because it doesn't develop as well it's not as good, and then because it's not as good, in the long run maybe fewer people will use it. I have total respect for that opinion, but I just don't believe it myself for most software.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Public domain vs. attribution-required licenses</p>
<p class="startli">The primary difference between public domain and, say, a Creative Commons commercial / non-share-alike / attribution license is solely the requirement for attribution. (Similarly the BSD license and such.) While I would <em>appreciate</em> acknowledgement and attribution, I believe that it is foolish to place a legal encumberment (i.e. a license) on the software <em>solely</em> to get attribution.</p>
<p class="startli">In other words, I'm arguing that PD is superior to the BSD license and the Creative Commons 'Attribution' license. If the license offers anything besides attribution &ndash; as does, e.g., CC NonCommercial-ShareAlike, or the GPL &ndash; that's a separate discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Other aspects of BSD-style licenses besides attribution</p>
<p class="startli">Permissive licenses like zlib and BSD license are perfectly reasonable in their requirements, but they are very wordy and have only two benefits over public domain: legally-mandated attribution and liability-control. I do not believe these are worth the excessive verbosity and user-unfriendliness these licenses induce, especially in the single-file case where those licenses tend to be at the top of the file, the first thing you see.</p>
<p class="startli">To the specific points, I have had no trouble receiving attribution for my libraries; liability in the face of no explicit disclaimer of liability is an open question, but one I have a lot of difficulty imagining there being any actual doubt about in court. Sometimes I explicitly note in my libraries that I make no guarantees about them being fit for purpose, but it's pretty absurd to do this; as a whole, it comes across as "here is a library to decode vorbis audio files, but it may not actually work and if you have problems it's not my fault, but also please report bugs so I can fix them"&ndash;so dumb!</p>

</ol>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">EASY-TO-COMPLY LICENSE</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">I make my libraries public domain. You don&#39;t have to.</div>
<div class="line">But my goal in releasing stb-style libraries is to</div>
<div class="line">reduce friction for potential users as much as</div>
<div class="line">possible. That means:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  a. easy to build (what this file is mostly about)</div>
<div class="line">  b. easy to invoke (which requires good API design)</div>
<div class="line">  c. easy to deploy (which is about licensing)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">I choose to place all my libraries in the public</div>
<div class="line">domain, abjuring copyright, rather than license</div>
<div class="line">the libraries. This has some benefits and some</div>
<div class="line">drawbacks.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Any license which is &quot;viral&quot; to modifications</div>
<div class="line">causes worries for lawyers, even if their programmers</div>
<div class="line">aren&#39;t modifying it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Any license which requires crediting in documentation</div>
<div class="line">adds friction which can add up. Valve used to have</div>
<div class="line">a page with a list of all of these on their web site,</div>
<div class="line">and it was insane, and obviously nobody ever looked</div>
<div class="line">at it so why would you care whether your credit appeared</div>
<div class="line">there?</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Permissive licenses like zlib and BSD license are</div>
<div class="line">perfectly reasonable, but they are very wordy and</div>
<div class="line">have only two benefits over public domain: legally-mandated</div>
<div class="line">attribution and liability-control. I do not believe these</div>
<div class="line">are worth the excessive verbosity and user-unfriendliness</div>
<div class="line">these licenses induce, especially in the single-file</div>
<div class="line">case where those licenses tend to be at the top of</div>
<div class="line">the file, the first thing you see. (To the specific</div>
<div class="line">points, I have had no trouble receiving attribution</div>
<div class="line">for my libraries; liability in the face of no explicit</div>
<div class="line">disclaimer of liability is an open question.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">However, public domain has frictions of its own, because</div>
<div class="line">public domain declarations aren&#39;t necessary recognized</div>
<div class="line">in the USA and some other locations. For that reason,</div>
<div class="line">I recommend a declaration along these lines:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">// This software is dual-licensed to the public domain and under the following</div>
<div class="line">// license: you are granted a perpetual, irrevocable license to copy, modify,</div>
<div class="line">// publish, and distribute this file as you see fit.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">I typically place this declaration at the end of the initial</div>
<div class="line">comment block of the file and just say &#39;public domain&#39;</div>
<div class="line">at the top.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">I have had people say they couldn&#39;t use one of my</div>
<div class="line">libraries because it was only &quot;public domain&quot; and didn&#39;t</div>
<div class="line">have the additional fallback clause, who asked if</div>
<div class="line">I could dual-license it under a traditional license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">My answer: they can create a derivative work by</div>
<div class="line">modifying one character, and then license that however</div>
<div class="line">they like. (Indeed, *adding* the zlib or BSD license</div>
<div class="line">would be such a modification!) Unfortunately, their</div>
<div class="line">lawyers reportedly didn&#39;t like that answer. :(</div>
